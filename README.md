# Fantasy-Football-Code
Python project for the boys

Overview: Use 2019 data given in dataset, already normalized, use the 2019 and 2020 data as the training data and then use actual 2021 data for the test data, 
select features, use machine learning model in order to predict which features are important, clean data, then use models (QDA, logistic regression, and support vector machines), create visuals, use predictors in order to find what the next years data will be, find error rate between prediction and actual 2021 data, and then we gucci.

WE WILL BLOW NIKOLAY'S SOCKS OFF!!!!!!!!


Process: 
1. import data from github into the Jupyter Notebook 
2. clean and then visual data in order get an idea of what we're working with
3. selecting features using .describe() pandas function
4. Fantasy points are the output for regression model, we find which values have the highest importance, we assign
high/low values to ranges for each variable, then we do a classification for high and low and we determine which players
have the highest propencity to perform well the next year




OUPUT VARIABLE: 2019 FPTS and 2020 FPTS
