# Fantasy-Football-Code
Python project for the boys

Overview: Use 2019 data given in dataset, already normalized, use the 2019 data as the training data and then use actual 2020 data for the test data, 
select features, use machine learning model in order to predict which features are important, clean data, then use models (QDA, logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines), create visuals, use predictors in order to find what the next years data will be, find error rate between prediction and actual 2020 data, and then we gucci.

WE WILL BLOW NIKOLAY'S SOCKS OFF!!!!!!!!


Process: 
1. import data from github into the Jupyter Notebook 
2. clean and then visual data in order get an idea of what we're working with
3. selecting features using .describe() pandas function
4.
